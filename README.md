# First-Rect-Project
This is the first time i've used react 

This is a react project that uses the component method to show/edit/add/delete users info from jsonplaceholder.typicode.

instructions:
This project uses react so you need to install react and copy all the files into the src folder.
Then you will need to install axios that is used to getting the data from the fake API.
Call the main component in the App.js which is the "Users" component.
Run "npm start" and you're done.
